        <p>The Whale is an 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is sailor Ishmael's narrative of the obsessive
            quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the ship's
            previous voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance,
            the work's genre classifications range from late Romantic to early Symbolist.
        </p>
        <p>Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's
            death in 1891. Its reputation as a "Great American Novel" was established only in the 20th century, after the
            centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written the book himself,[1] and
            D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world" and "the greatest book
            of the sea ever written".[2] Its opening sentence, "Call me Ishmael", is among world literature's most famous.[3]
            Melville began writing Moby-Dick in February 1850, and would eventually take 18 months to write the book, a full
            year more than he had first anticipated. Writing was interrupted by his making the acquaintance of Nathaniel
            Hawthorne in August 1850, and by the creation of the "Mosses from an Old Manse" essay as a first result of that
            friendship. The book is dedicated to Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius". The basis for the
            work is Melville's 1841 whaling voyage aboard the Acushnet.
        </p>
        <p>The novel also draws on whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The white
            whale is modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, and the book's ending is based on
            the sinking of the whaleship Essex in 1820. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting
            whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and
            social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles
            and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies,
            and asides.</p>
